# ncom_udp_forwarder
This ROS2 package provides a simple yet effective node, ncom_udp_forwarder, designed to subscribe to an oxts_msgs/msg/Ncom topic and forward the raw NCOM data payload as a UDP packet. This is particularly useful for interfacing with real-time visualization tools like OxTS's NAVdisplay while replaying data from a rosbag.
